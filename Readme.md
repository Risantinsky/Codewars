## Description
In this directory I will upload the challenges from the Codewars page. It will be divided into 5 levels (Novice, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Master). Inside the project folders you'll find a readme file that explains the exercise and the src folder with the files.

## Objective
I started these types of challenges because I want to put my skills into practice and learn new ways of coding. And I also wanted to have something to show on my GitHub.

## Technologies
I will use _Java_ to do these exercises and _IntelliJ IDEA_ to code. The java version will be clarified within the readme of each project.
